# NSFP-DEMO (NSFileProtectionType)
An application I have developed to demonstrate Apple File Protection APIs (NSFileProtectionType)

This small application can be run on a jailbroken or non jailbroken device, and allows you to...
  - Write Files To Disk (Local Application Data Container)
  - Read Files From Disk (Local Application Data Container)
  - Delete Files From Disk (Local Application Data Container)
  - List Files & Associated File Protection Key (Local Application Data Container)
  - List Certain System Directories
